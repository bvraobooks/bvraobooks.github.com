<p>
  B.V.Rao Books is the latest children book publishing house based in India. It focuses on publishing culturally diverse books that are aimed at young and beginner readers, worldwide.

<p>
  Indian mythology includes epics such as Mahabharata and Ramayana, and pura&#772;n&#803;as such as  Bhagavatam.
  It is  a rich source of imagination, fantasy and learning.
  The initial series of books are  centered on kid-friendly stories drawn from Indian mythology.
</p>

<p>
  A much larger  goal of the books from our publishing house is to not only promote early reading but also preserve and nurture the regional languages of India.
  Millions of Indians who have settled outside India routinely face the <em>language dilemma</em>: should their children be raised bilingual?
  If so, where to find the relevant old and contemporary literature in the regional languages?
</p>

<p>
       Scientific research  shows that bilingual children not only have better language development but also excel at information processing and problem-solving skills.
       We hope that our books become an useful resource for learning diverse cultures and languages.
