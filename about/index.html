  Indian mythology includes epics such as Mahabharata and Ramayana, and pura&#772;n&#803;as such as  Bhagavatam.
  It is  a rich source of imagination, fantasy and learning.
  The initial series of books are  centered on kid-friendly stories drawn from Indian mythology.

  Millions of Indians who have settled outside India routinely face the <em>language dilemma</em>: should their children be raised bilingual?
  If so, where to find the relevant old and contemporary literature in the regional languages?
</p>

<p  align="justified">
       Scientific research  shows that bilingual children not only have better language development but also excel at information processing and problem-solving skills.
       An overarching goal of  our publishing house is to not only promote early reading but also preserve and nurture the regional languages of India by making multi-language editions of each book available to our readers.
       We hope that our books become a useful resource for learning diverse cultures and languages.
